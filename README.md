# HW1-MakeUp

Introduction:

The goal is to create a set of search algorithms that find solutions to the 15-puzzle problem. The task is requested to implement the programs to the 15-puzzle problem using

1.	breadth-first search (BFS) 
2.	depth-first search (DFS)
3.	Informed Search using Heuristic

The output should show:

Output:

1. Searching strategy
2. Moves
3. Number of nodes expanded
4. Time taken
5. Memory used
